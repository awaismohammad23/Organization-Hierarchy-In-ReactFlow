# Organization-Hierarchy-In-ReactFlow

This repository will provide a hierarchy of employees of an organization. Since there are multiple positions in an organization. For example, there is a CEO of a company, then there are Managers and the hierarchy goes through the top-down approach in a tree form. We will try to create a hierarchy where we will use a top-down approach and who's working under a Director.

# Structure

The following structure starts with the Director who will have the most authority over everyone, then there is a deputy director. Then some coordinators will work under the director and deputy director. After that, there are team leads who will be leading small groups of members who will work under the team leads. 

                              Director
